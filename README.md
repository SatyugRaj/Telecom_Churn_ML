# Telecom_Churn_ML
This assignment aims to predict if a customer will churn or not.

In this assignment I have build  a model which predicts if an existing customer will churn or not based on past data.
And then accordingly the telecom company can send offers and coupons to the correct customers in order to retain them.
I have used Logistic Regression approach in this assignment.
Three data sets have been used, Churn data is the past data of the telecom company, customer data is the details of the customer, and internet data has the data for type of internet service taken by customer.
